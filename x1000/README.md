This project was a look into file writing, multithreading and functional programming. I saw an example of an interesting example of functional programming in Rust by Example, so I tried it myself. The script creates a 1000 by 1000 grid of numbers from 0 to 9 and then calculates the total sum. On my mac, multithreading does not seem to speed up the program. Perhaps if there were more numbers...
