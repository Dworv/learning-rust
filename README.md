# learning-rust

I am very interested about learning Rust. It's an exciting programming languange that will probably continue to be useful for a long while, but it is also a breath of fresh air from the sometimes overbearingly free nature of Python (no disrespect, obniously, I still love Python). It forces me to be careful and considerate with how I structure my code and forces me to understand how my programs work. Learning it absolutely makes me a better developer.

This is a repository of the different projects I have completed (and sometimes given up on) in my journey of learning the Rust programming language.
